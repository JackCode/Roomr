# Roomr
 Internal Hotel Room Search Tool

In 2020, I was working in a 150-year-old hotel in Cincinnati, OH as a Front Desk Supervisor. Older, boutique-style hotels tend to have a lot of variety in their room layouts, features, and sizes; this hotel was no exception. When I created Roomr, I was looking for a quick solution to help my team be able to sort through all of these differences and efficiently show guests the variety without physically taking them to the rooms.

While I had some earlier background in C++ and had been learning Golang at the time, Java was new to me. I also didn't have any front-end experience. I found the Vaadin framework while learning Java basics and decided to use it for Roomr, mostly to keep all of my code in one language.

We used Roomr in the hotel as a PWA and active website for a year. Our team called it the "Hotel Bible". It wasn't perfect, but it performed well enough to suit the needs of our front desk staff. With a promotion, I left that hotel and was no longer able to maintain and support the code.
